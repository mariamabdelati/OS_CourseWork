/*
    Assume that for a certain system, it has a 32-bit virtual address with a 4-KB page size.
Write a program that takes a virtual address (in decimal) on the command line and outputs the
page number and offset for that given address. For example, if we input 19986 to the program,
the output would be:
    The address 19986 contains:
    page number = 4
    offset = 3602
You should use an appropriate data type to store 32 bits. Also, it will be a good idea to use
unsigned data types as well.
